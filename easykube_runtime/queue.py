class Queue:
    """
    Queue of (request, attempt) tuples representing requests to reconcile objects.

    The queue is "smart" in a few ways:

      1. It has explicit operations for enqueuing a new request and requeuing a request that
         has previously been attempted.

      2. Requeuing of a request that has been previously attempted only happens after a delay.
         This happens asynchronously so that it does not block the worker from moving on to the
         next request.

      3. At most one request per object can be in the queue at any given time.

      4. Only one request per object is allowed to be "active" at any given time.
         The queue records when a request leaves the queue and does not allow any more requests
         for the same object to leave the queue until it has been notified that the
         previous request has been completed (either explicitly or by requeuing).

    Note that this means that requests for objects that are changing often will be pushed to
    the back of the queue.
